### 2. Configuration

Open the **Project Settings** and navigate to the **Chat System Plugin** section. Here's what each setting means:

- **OpenAI API Key:** Your secret key for accessing OpenAI models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4). Required for OpenAI-powered chat.
- **Gemini API Key:** Your Google Gemini API key. Required for Gemini-powered chat.
- **Provider:** Choose which AI provider to use for chat (OpenAI or Gemini).
- **OpenAI Model:** Select the specific OpenAI model (e.g., gpt-4o-mini) for chat.
- **Gemini Model:** Select the specific Gemini model for chat.
- **Enable Context Memory:** If enabled, the chatbot will remember previous messages for more natural conversations.
- **Context Message Count:** How many previous messages are included as context. **Warning:** Using a large value here can quickly consume your API quota. This will be improved soon with automatic context summarization.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- **API Keys:** Make sure your API keys are valid and have sufficient quota.
- **Model Support:** Some models may not support images. Choose a model with image support for best results.
- **Settings Not Updating:** If changes to API keys or settings do not take effect, try closing and reopening the chatbot window.
- **Clearing Chat History:** To clear the chatbot history, delete the JSON file located at:
  - `<ProjectDir>/Saved/ChatHistory/_chat_history.json`
  Then, reopen the chatbot.
- **Large Context Warning:** Setting a high context message count can increase API usage and cost. Upcoming updates will add context summarization to optimize this.
- **Logs:** Check the Output Log for error messages if something isn't working as expected.
